In applicative-order Scheme, when call (factorial 5), the call will not end. because, when call unless, even if (= n 1) is true, (factorial (- n 1)) will be called. so n will be 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 .... . In normal-order Scheme, this will work, Because normal-order Scheme uses lazy evaluation, when (= n 1) is true, (factorial n) will not be called.
